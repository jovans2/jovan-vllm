Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), commonly known as chronic diseases,
are health conditions that are not transmittable from person to person. Instead,
they result from unhealthy lifestyles and are influenced by a combination of
genetic, physiological, environmental, and behavioral factors. These diseases
persist over a long period of time (normally more than 1 year) and can be critical
to a person’s health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the four
major types of non-communicable diseases are cardiovascular diseases,
cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes.
Since 2000, the number of deaths caused by non-communicable diseases
has been steadily rising globally. Research indicates that non-communicable
diseases currently account for 74% of all deaths worldwide, claiming an average
of 41 million lives each year. The leading cause of NCD-related deaths is
cardiovascular diseases, with 17.9 million fatalities annually. Cancers and chronic
respiratory diseases also contribute significantly to NCD-related deaths, with 9.3
million and 4.1 million deaths respectively, followed by diabetes, including its
related kidney disease, which accounts for 2 million deaths (WHO, 2022). Non-communicable diseases are a growing concern, affecting individuals of all ages,
not just the late elderly. Each year, 17 million people lost their lives due to non-communicable diseases before reaching 70 years of age, with 85% of these
premature (i.e. 30-69 years of age) deaths occurring in low- and middle-income
countries. The four types of non-communicable diseases mentioned earlier are
the main culprits for the majority of all premature NCD fatalities, accounting for
over 80% of deaths. (WHO, 2022).
The heavy burden of non-communicable diseases among individuals of
working age results in elevated healthcare expenses, reduced work capacity, and
financial instability. This unseen epidemic is a frequently overlooked source of
poverty and impedes the economic growth of numerous countries. Its impact is
intensifying, as the number of individuals, households, and communities affected
is on the rise and shows no signs of slowing down. Unfortunately, the occurrence
of premature NCD deaths is more prevalent in low- and middle-income countries.
The major cause of this might be due to the rapidly growing population, lacking
access to high-quality healthcare services, practicing unhealthy lifestyles, and
poverty. Additionally, 77% of all NCD deaths, regardless of age group, occur in
low- and middle-income countries. This is a concerning issue as NCDs are chronic
in nature and demand substantial investment in terms of time and money for
treatment, which can result in financial strain for individuals from low and middle-income countries.
rtunately, most non-communicable diseases are preventable. Most non-communicable diseases are caused by common, modifiable risk factors such as
tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, unhealthy diets, and physical
inactivity. By adopting healthy lifestyle habits, the community has the potential to
prevent up to 80% of strokes, heart diseases, type 2 diabetes, and over one-third
of cancers from taking place. In conclusion, the rise of non-communicable
diseases is not an issue to be taken lightly, as it is the root cause of widespread
fatalities, underlying health concerns, and weakened economic development on
a global scale, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The impact of
these diseases on global health is a clarion call, urging us to act swiftly and
decisively to prevent and take respective actions to put an end to them. To
effectively address this growing health crisis, we must employ effective
prevention and management strategies by utilising the existing knowledge we
have today to brainstorm new innovative and cost-effective solutions***********************************write a blog article with outlines and like a biography
